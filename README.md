# CSE422_ML_FinalProject
This is the final project of CSE422, where we use a dataset of more than 4000 people to determine stroke prediction using ML techniques. We have used  Logistic regression, Decision tree and Neural Network as models and found their prediction accuracy, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve.
This was a group project of two indivituals.
